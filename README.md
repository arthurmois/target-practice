Target practice FPS minigame using WebGL    https://arthurmois.github.io/target-practice/

A minigame utilizing VERTEX and FRAGMENT shaders to build MVP environment with, rendering, lighting, shading.
As well as camera movement and "shooting" functionality using vector/matrix arithmetic.

Just like any FPS: WASD, point and shoot :)
